## Setup

```bash
mix deps.get
mix compile
cd assets && npm install && node run build && cd ..
mix ecto.reset
mix run --no-halt
```

This will start a server on port 5555 that you can connect with using the `local.tin` tintin++ config. Ecto reset will include a sample area, classes, skills, and a login. You can also load [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) in your browser for the admin panel and web client.

## Running Tests

```bash
MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create
MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.migrate
mix test
```

## Web Client

A web client is hosted by the game. Once it is running locally, you can access it via [http://localhost:4000/play](http://localhost:4000/play]).

## Admin Panel

There is an admin panel located at [http://locahost:4000/admin](http://localhost:4000/admin) that you can build out the game in. Create zones, rooms, npcs, items, etc. in the panel. They will become live instantly on creating or updating.

You can see more on [exventure.org](https://exventure.org/admin/).
